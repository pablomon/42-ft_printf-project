# ft_printf

The prototype of ft_printf should be int ft_printf(const char *, ...);

• You have to recode the libc’s printf function

• It must not do the buffer management like the real printf

• It will manage the following conversions: cspdiuxX%

• It will manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.*’ and minimum field width

• It will be compared with the real printf
